&index_title1=About CalBook...
&index_txt1=<b>Although recording down daily expenses is a little troublesome and some may think that it is not that important,</b><br />but it does help in financial budgeting. It is difficult for us not to be frugal if we record down our daily expenses because we will be surprised with the amount of money we have spent. "Hmm... now I know why my bank is always empty."<br />will actually make us frugal almost automatically. We may even feel proud if there are days with zero expenditure.Besides helping us keep track of your expenses, the record also serves as a diary. We would remember what we did on a certain day by looking at the things we spent. I actually retrieve my vehicle maintenance date here to to estimate whether my vehicle needs for example an oil change already.

&page1_readmore_title1=brief about Daily Expense

&page1_readmore_txt1=In common usage, an expense or expenditure is an outflow of money to another person or group to pay for an item or service, or for a category of costs. For a tenant, rent is an expense. For students or parents, tuition is an expense. Buying food, clothing, furniture or an automobile is often referred to as an expense. An expense is a cost that is "paid" or "remitted", usually in exchange for something of value. Something that seems to cost a great deal is "expensive". Something that seems to cost little is "inexpensive". "Expenses of the table" are expenses of dining, refreshments, a feast, etc.
In accounting, expense has a very specific meaning. It is an outflow of cash or other valuable assets from a person or company to another person or company. This outflow of cash is generally one side of a trade for products or services that have equal or better current or future value to the buyer than to the seller.&

&page1_readmore_txt2=You should update your expenses before or at the end of everyday. Anytime when you suddenly think of it, update it. Do not procrastinate or else you will waste time trying to recall the expenditure. You may highlight the ones that should not be spent or are spent by mistake while entering the figures. You can start recording the daily expenses on the first day of any week, not necessarily on the first day of the month or the year.
In double-entry bookkeeping, expenses are recorded as a debit to an expense account (an income statement account) and a credit to either an asset account or a liability account, which are balance sheet accounts. An expense decreases assets or increases liabilities. Typical business expenses include salaries, utilities, depreciation of capital assets, and interest expense for loans. The purchase of a capital asset such as a building or equipment is not an expense.&

&page2_readmore_title1=Idea about Grids View 

&page2_readmore_txt1=Many people think about Web design layouts in terms of columns. They ask for instructions on how to create a 3 column layout or a 2 column Layout, and so on. But there is more to good layout design than just how many columns there are. In fact, you should be thinking about design in terms of a grid of columns and rows. But before you start feeling confined and rigid in your designs let's look a little more closely at grids and how they can benefit you.
The problem is, most beginning designers feel that designing on a grid is boring. And it definitely can be. This is especially true if you use the grid as a mandate to fill in every square of the grid with something. The point of a grid is not as a way to fill up space, but to help you organize the space you have.
Once you understand how to set up your pages using a grid system, then you can start moving away from the rigid grids to create more elegant websites that work even if you can't see the grid at first glance.&

&page2_readmore_title2=Idea about Reports and Charts 

&page2_readmore_txt2=The pie chart is perhaps the most ubiquitous statistical chart in the business world and the mass media. However, it has been criticized,and some recommend avoiding it,pointing out in particular that it is difficult to compare different sections of a given pie chart, or to compare data across different pie charts. Pie charts can be an effective way of displaying information in some cases, in particular if the intent is to compare the size of a slice with the whole pie, rather than comparing the slices among them. Pie charts work particularly well when the slices represent 25 to 50% of the data, but in general, other plots such as the bar chart or the dot plot, or non-graphical methods such as tables, may be more adapted for representing certain information. &

&page3_txt1=<b>Extendable Java Script gives this portal a magic look.</b><br />Ext JS (ee-X-t JS) is a JavaScript library for building interactive web applications using techniques such as Ajax, DHTML and DOM scripting.
&third_txt1=<b>Spring Architecture</b><br><br>The Spring Framework has its own AOP framework which modularizes cross-cutting concerns in aspects. The motivation for creating a separate AOP framework comes from the belief that it would be possible to provide basic AOP features without too much complexity in either design, implementation, or configuration. The Spring AOP framework also takes full advantage of the Spring Container.&

&fourth_txt2=A software development methodology is a framework that is used to structure, plan, and control the process of developing information systems. A wide variety of such frameworks have evolved over the years, each with its own recognized strengths and weaknesses. One system development methodology is not necessarily suitable for use by all projects.

&page4_readmore_title1=Requirement Analysis

&page4_readmore_txt1=Requirements analysis in systems engineering and software engineering, encompasses those tasks that go into determining the needs or conditions to meet for a new or altered product, taking account of the possibly conflicting requirements of the various stakeholders, such as beneficiaries or users.
Requirements analysis is critical to the success of a development project. Requirements must be documented, actionable, measurable, testable, traceable, related to identified business needs or opportunities, and defined to a level of detail sufficient for system design. Requirements can be architectural, structural, behavioral, functional, and non-functional.

&page4_readmore_title2=Development view

&page4_readmore_txt2=Software development (also known as application development, software design, designing software, software application development, enterprise application development, or platform development) is the development of a software product. The term "software development" may be used to refer to the activity of computer programming, which is the process of writing and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense of the term it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, ideally in a planned and structured process. Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products
